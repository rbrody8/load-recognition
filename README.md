# load-recognition
This is a repository for Matlab code used to detect load type based on voltage and current profiles.

To run this algorithm, first download the contents of this repository. Make sure all .m files are all in the same directory. Then in Matlab, run detect_load(*directory of training data*,*directory of test data*).
